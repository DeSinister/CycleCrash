# CycleCrash


## Overview
Recent developments in computer vision have notably featured extensive labelled datasets of urban environments, primarily focused on advancing self-driving cars. In contrast, there is an absence of datasets specifically considering cyclist collisions and safety. To address this, we introduce CycleCrash, a novel dataset comprising 3,000 dashcam video clips, totaling 436,347 frames that capture cyclists in diverse real-world scenarios, including both accident and non-accident clips. This dataset targets potentially hazardous conditions for cyclists and is annotated with collision-related, cyclist-related, and scene-related labels. Furthermore, we present VidNeXt, a novel method that adapts a non-stationary transformer structure originally proposed for forecasting multivariate time series data, toward problems of classification and regression of video within our dataset. Weâ€™ve also applied and compared 7 additional baseline models and detailed ablation for our method on 9 cyclist collision prediction and classification tasks.
